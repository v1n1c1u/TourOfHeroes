# Tour Of Heroes App

 This is my first SPA with Angular. It is a wikipedia-like website about Marvel's characters and it was built based on the tutorial available on [Angular's website](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes).
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
