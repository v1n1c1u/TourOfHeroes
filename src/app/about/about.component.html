            This website is a showcase of my web development skills with
            Angular and Typescript. It is a 'wikipedia-like' website about
            Marvel's characters based on the tutorial available on
            <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes" target="_blank">Angular's website</a>!
